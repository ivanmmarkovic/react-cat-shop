# react-cat-shop

This is old project from 2016. I have made changes only in css file. In *oldversion.zip* is just old css and javascript.

[Codepen project](https://codepen.io/ivanmarkovic/pen/yaWJBd)

I didn't use router, just switching component's visibility.

I have similar app with router : 
- [React ecommerce](https://github.com/ivanmmarkovic/react-ecommerce)
- [Take a look](https://react-3jfadt.stackblitz.io/)

Clone project, navigate to directory, run *npm-i* and *npm-start*.
